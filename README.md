## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **/Arduino_Code_Examples/**: Contains the Arduino code examples for various projects. Each folder represents a unique project with its own `README.md` for detailed information and instructions.
- **/Proteus_Simulations/**: This folder contains the Proteus design files (`.pdsprj`) for each Arduino example. These files are ready to run and simulate using the Proteus software.
- **/Proteus_Libraries/**: Essential Proteus libraries for components like Arduino boards and sensors that are not natively available in Proteus. Make sure to add these to your Proteus installation.
- **/Footprints_and_3D_Models/**: Includes required footprints and 3D CAD models for components used in the simulations, ensuring accuracy in both PCB design and visualization.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Arduino IDE**: Download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE from the official [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- **Proteus Software**: You will need Proteus for simulating the projects. You can download it from the [Labcenter website](https://www.labcenter.com/).
- **Proteus Libraries**: To ensure smooth simulation, copy the libraries provided in the `/Proteus_Libraries/` folder into your Proteus installation directory.
- **Footprints and 3D Models**: For detailed PCB design, add the provided footprints and 3D models to your CAD software.

### How to Run the Projects

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-proteus-examples.git
    ```

2. **Upload the Arduino code**:
    - Open the `.ino` files in the Arduino IDE.
    - Upload the code to your Arduino board if you are testing it on hardware.

3. **Simulate in Proteus**:
    - Open the corresponding project file from the `/Proteus_Simulations/` folder in Proteus.
    - Ensure you have copied the required libraries from the `/Proteus_Libraries/` folder into your Proteus installation.
    - Run the simulation to see the Arduino code in action.

4. **Use Footprints and 3D Models** (Optional):
    - If you are working on the PCB design or need accurate 3D visualizations, use the included footprints and 3D models from the `/Footprints_and_3D_Models/` folder.

## üìö Included Projects

Here are some of the examples you'll find in this repository:

- **Blinking LED**: A simple project to control an LED using an Arduino.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Read data from a temperature sensor and display it on an LCD.
- **Servo Motor Control**: Control the position of a servo motor with an Arduino.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Use an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and display the readings.
- **Motor Driver Example**: Interface a motor driver with an Arduino to control the speed and direction of a DC motor.

Each project is contained in its own folder with detailed documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries, Footprints, and 3D Models

- **Proteus Libraries**: Includes Arduino Mega/Uno/Nano libraries, sensors, LCD modules, motor drivers, and other commonly used components.
- **Footprints**: Detailed footprints for custom components used in the simulations, ensuring precise PCB design.
- **3D Models**: Accurate 3D CAD models for visualization of the components used in the projects.

Ensure these files are integrated into your respective software for an enhanced design and simulation experience.
