## üì• How to Use Library Loader in Proteus

**Library Loader** is a tool that allows you to add real-time component libraries, including footprints and simulation models, directly into **Proteus**. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to using the Library Loader:

### Step 1: Download and Install Library Loader
1. **Download Library Loader** from [Samacsys](https://componentsearchengine.com/libraryloader).
2. Install the software on your system.

### Step 2: Configure Library Loader for Proteus
1. **Open Library Loader**.
2. During setup, select **Proteus** as your target CAD tool.
3. Set the directory where your **Proteus Libraries** are installed.  
   - The typical path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 8 Professional\LIBRARY`.
4. Finish the configuration.

### Step 3: Search for Components in Library Loader
1. In **Library Loader**, use the **Search** option to find the component you need.
   - Example: Search for "Arduino Uno" or any sensor/module you plan to use.
2. Once found, click **Download** to retrieve the component.

### Step 4: Automatically Add to Proteus
1. Library Loader will automatically download and install the footprint, schematic symbol, and 3D model (if available) into your **Proteus Library**.
2. Open **Proteus**, go to **Library** > **Pick Devices**, and search for the newly added component in the component search bar.

### Step 5: Use the Component in Your Project
1. Once the component is found in Proteus, you can add it directly to your schematic or PCB design.
2. If a 3D model is available, you will also be able to visualize the component in 3D when designing your PCB.

### Adding ZIP Libraries to Proteus

In some cases, you may need to import component libraries that are distributed as ZIP files. Here‚Äôs how to add them to Proteus:

1. Download the ZIP file from your preferred source (e.g., SnapEDA, GitHub, Symacsys).
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Copy the extracted `.IDX`, `.LIB`, and other library files to the **Library** folder in your Proteus installation directory.
   - The path typically looks like this: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 8 Professional\LIBRARY`
4. Restart Proteus, and the new libraries should now be available.

---

## Running the Projects

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-proteus-examples.git
    ```
2. **Upload the Arduino code**:  
    - Open `.ino` files in the Arduino IDE and upload to your Arduino hardware.
   
3. **Simulate in Proteus**:  
    - Open the corresponding `.pdsprj` file from the `/Proteus_Simulations/` folder and run the simulation in Proteus.

4. **Footprints and 3D Models**:  
    - Integrate the models into your PCB design for enhanced accuracy.
